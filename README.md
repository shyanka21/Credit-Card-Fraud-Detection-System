# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-System

## ABSTRACT
Due to the rise and rapid growth of E-Commerce, use of credit cards for online purchases has dramatically increased and it caused an explosion in the credit card fraud. As credit card becomes the most popular mode of payment for both online as well as regular purchase, cases of fraud associated with it are also rising. In real life, fraudulent transactions are scattered with genuine transactions and simple pattern matching techniques are not often sufficient to detect those frauds accurately. Implementation of efficient fraud detection systems has thus become imperative for all credit card issuing banks to minimize their losses. Many modern techniques based on Artificial Intelligence, Data mining, Fuzzy logic, Machine learning, Sequence Alignment, Genetic Programming etc., has evolved in detectingvarious credit card fraudulent transactions. A clear understanding on all these approaches will certainly lead to an efficient credit card fraud detection system. This paper presents a survey of various techniques used in credit card fraud detection mechanisms and evaluates each methodology based on certain design criteria.


## SCOPE
The proposed architecture is  designed to detect credit card fraud in online payments, and emphasis is made to provide a fraud prevention system to verify a transaction as fraudulent or legitimate. For implementation purposes it is assumed that issuer and acquirer bank is connected to each other. If this system is to be implemented in real time scenario then exchange of best practices and raising consumer awareness among people can be very helpful in reducing the losses caused by fraudulent transactions. Further enhancement can be done by making this system secure with the use of certificates for both merchant and customer and as technology changes new checks can be added to understand the pattern of fraudulent transactions and to alert the respective card holders and bankers when fraud activity is identified. The dataset available on day to day processing may become outdated, it is necessary to have updated data for effective fraud behavior identification. To this extent, the incremental approach is necessary in making the system to learn from past as well as present data and capable of handling the both. Fraudster uses different new techniques that are instantaneously growing along with new technology makes it difficult for detection. 


## PROBLEM DEFINITION
The Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem includes modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud. This model is then used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. Our aim here is to detect 100% of the fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications.

## METHODOLOGY USED
1. K-MEANS CLUSTERING
2. LOGISTIC REGRESSION
